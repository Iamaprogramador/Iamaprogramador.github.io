The best of poems from ChatGPT.<br>
<div id="wide-awake">
  <p>My mom says I need to sleep,<br>
But my brain's still wide awake,<br>
I've counted all the sheep,<br>
And now I'm wide awake.</p>
<p>I've tried to close my eyes,<br>
And think of happy things,<br>
But my mind just won't comply,<br>
And now the night just sings.</p>
<p>The clock keeps ticking away,<br>
And morning's almost near,<br>
I'm just a little dismayed,<br>
As I yawn and shed a tear.</p>
<p>But wait, what's that I hear?<br>
Could it be a snore?<br>
Oh no, it's just my cat, dear,<br>
Sleeping like a boar.</p>
<p>I guess I'll give up the fight,<br>
And try to get some rest,<br>
Maybe I'll dream tonight,<br>
Of a big breakfast feast.</p>
