Everyone is glued to their screens and no one takes the time to be out in nature or quietly think through their thoughts. No one, that is, except for a few individuals still holding to an old nineteenth-century value: transcendentalism. Transcendentalists do things themselves and often prefer spending time in nature to working in the city or constantly using their devices. Christopher Paolini is an example of one of these rare modern transcendentalists because he, like Thoreau and Emerson of old, spends his time in nature and discovering his own knowledge and understanding.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Paolini was homeschooled by his mother, he has learned to develop his own interpretation of life, instead of taking for granted what society tells him to believe. Paolini&rsquo;s mother developed a method of homeschooling very similar to what you might expect a modern transcendentalist curriculum to be, involving lengthy periods in nature, among other things 1. In his official biography at paolini.net, we also learn that he enjoyed reading books about the Middle Ages, and formed his own ideas and interpretations based on that knowledge. Throughout Paolini&rsquo;s childhood, Christopher has lived with transcendental values.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Paolini became famous and left home, he chose to live in a place where he could be close to nature: Montana. While in Montana, Christopher spent the majority of his time in the wilderness: &ldquo;forging his own knives and swords, making chain mail, spinning wool,....felling trees, hiking, and camping.&rdquo; 2 Doing these activities by choice when he could have been using his copious profits from the sales of his books could certainly be regarded as transcendentalist. In addition, he did much of his research for his new science fiction series by himself, to ensure that all of the information in the books would be correct. Doing his own research is another fundamental transcendentalist characteristic. His first choices as a free adult show that he is dedicated to being a transcendentalist.</span></p><p class="c6"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only does Christopher uphold transcendentalist values in his personal life, but he also writes characters that are transcendentalist in their behaviors. In his main series, </span><span class="c10">The Inheritance Cycle</span><span class="c5">, the protagonist is a &ldquo;simple farm boy&rdquo; named Eragon who discovers a dragon egg. Most of the plot of the series then consists of a colossal story arc of character development where Eragon becomes a mighty warrior and knowledgeable magician-all through his power from being bonded to his dragon, Saphira 3. This story is a giant tale of how this simple boy, through the transcendentalist spirit of figuring things out for himself, could achieve greatness.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher Paolini, in this modern world packed full of commercialists, is a rare transcendentalist individual. He loves to be in nature, and also follows the habits of self-reflection and self-determination: having his own thoughts and doing things his own way, and the way society typically does. Furthermore, the arc of character development in his New York Time #1 Bestselling Series is a story of transcendentalism. We should all strive to follow his example and follow the spirit of transcendentalism.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c5">Sources:</span></p><p class="c6"><span>The Paolini Method.
